# Flutter Minimalist state management example

Because the [official Flutter website] mentions 13 different ways to do state management, why not
yet another state management example. The official Flutter [cupertino-store codelabs] is used as
basis, but instead of using the Provider pattern the [Minimalist approach] is
used. Shout out to [@mvolpato] for sharing it and [@suragch1] for writing it.
